# Implementation Summary

## Mesh Simplification with MDD and LME (2-Ring Neighborhood Support)

This document provides a technical summary of the mesh simplification implementation based on the concepts from the paper "Out-of-Core Framework for QEM-based Mesh Simplification", including the implementation of 2-ring neighborhood support for Minimal Simplification Domains (MDD).

---

## Problem Statement

Implement a mesh simplification algorithm that:
1. Partitions large meshes into smaller sub-meshes (MDD - Minimal Simplification Domain) with 2-ring neighborhood support
2. Simplifies each sub-mesh independently (LME - Local Minimal Edges) with accurate QEM calculations
3. Merges simplified sub-meshes back into a single output mesh
4. Preserves geometric details during simplification
5. Ensures topological coherence through 2-ring neighborhoods

---

## Implementation Overview

### Key Components

1. **MeshPartitioner** (`mesh_simplification_mdd_lme.py`)
   - Implements spatial partitioning using octree subdivision
   - **NEW: Topology-based 2-ring neighborhood calculation**

   - QEMSimplifier: Core quadric error metric algorithm

## 2-Ring Neighborhood Implementation

### Motivation

The 2-ring neighborhood is essential for accurate QEM-based mesh simplification in partitioned meshes:

1. **Quadric Error Accuracy**: The quadric error matrix for a vertex depends on all adjacent faces. Without 2-ring context, partitions would miss important face information, leading to inaccurate error calculations.

2. **Edge Collapse Decisions**: When collapsing an edge, the optimal position calculation requires knowledge of neighboring vertices and faces up to 2 edges away.

3. **Topological Coherence**: The 2-ring provides sufficient topological context to make simplification decisions that are consistent with the global mesh structure.

4. **MDD Requirement**: The paper "Out-of-Core Framework for QEM-based Mesh Simplification" explicitly specifies 2-ring neighborhoods as a requirement for minimal simplification domains.

### Algorithm Components

#### 1. Vertex Adjacency Graph (`build_vertex_adjacency`)

```python
def build_vertex_adjacency(self) -> Dict[int, Set[int]]:
    """Build topology-based vertex-to-vertex adjacency from face connectivity."""
```

- Constructs a graph where edges connect vertices that share a face edge
- Time complexity: O(F) where F is the number of faces
- Space complexity: O(V + E) where V is vertices and E is edges

#### 2. N-Ring Neighborhood Calculation (`compute_n_ring_neighborhood`)

```python
def compute_n_ring_neighborhood(self, vertex_set: Set[int], n: int = 1) -> Set[int]:
    """Compute the n-ring neighborhood using breadth-first expansion."""
```

- Performs iterative breadth-first expansion from initial vertex set
- For n=1: Returns all directly connected vertices
- For n=2: Returns all vertices within 2 edge hops
- Time complexity: O(V + E) in worst case
- Space complexity: O(V) for storing neighborhoods

#### 3. Partition Expansion (`partition_octree`)

The updated `partition_octree` method now performs:

**Phase 1: Spatial Partitioning**
```
1. Calculate mesh bounding box
2. Compute center point
3. Assign each vertex to an octant (0-7) based on position
4. Store these as "core vertices" for each partition
```

**Phase 2: 2-Ring Expansion**
```
1. For each partition:
   - Compute 2-ring neighborhood of core vertices
   - Store extended vertex set (core + 2-ring)
   - Track expansion statistics
```

**Phase 3: Face Assignment**
```
1. For each face:
   - Assign to partitions where all vertices are in extended set
   - Mark vertices on spatial boundaries as border vertices
```

**Phase 4: Border Classification**
```
1. For each partition:
   - Mark vertices not in core as border (2-ring extension)
   - Mark vertices on spatial boundaries as border
   - These border vertices will not be simplified
```

### Data Structure Changes

Each partition now contains:
```python
{
    'core_vertices': set(),      # NEW: Vertices in spatial bounds
    'vertices': set(),            # All vertices (core + 2-ring)
    'faces': [],                  # Faces touching this partition
    'is_border': set()           # Border vertices (2-ring + boundaries)
}
```

### Simplification Changes

**Face Filtering**: After simplification, only faces with at least one core vertex are included in the output:

```python
# Filter faces to only include those with core vertices
core_faces = []
for face in simplified_faces:
    if any_vertex_from_core(face):
        core_faces.append(face)
```

This prevents duplication of faces from 2-ring overlaps.

**Merging Optimization**: Only vertices actually used by faces are included in the final mesh:

```python
# First pass: collect used vertices from faces
used_vertices = set()
for submesh_idx, face in faces:
    for v in face:
        used_vertices.add((submesh_idx, v))

# Second pass: only process used vertices
```

This eliminates unused 2-ring vertices from the output.

## Algorithm Flow

### Step 1: Partitioning (MDD) with 2-Ring Neighborhoods

```
Input: Mesh (vertices, faces)
Output: List of partitions with 2-ring neighborhoods and border information

1. Calculate mesh bounding box
2. Compute center point
3. Assign each vertex to an octant (0-7) based on position → core vertices

4. For each partition:
   a. Build vertex adjacency graph (if not already built)
   b. Compute 2-ring neighborhood of core vertices:
      - Start with core vertices
      - Add all directly connected vertices (1-ring)
      - Add all vertices connected to 1-ring (2-ring)
   c. Store extended vertex set (core + 1-ring + 2-ring)

5. For each face:
   a. Assign to partitions where all vertices are in extended set
   b. If face vertices span multiple spatial partitions → mark as border

6. For each partition:
   a. Mark vertices not in core as border (2-ring extension)
   b. Mark vertices on spatial boundaries as border
```

### Step 2: Local Simplification (LME) with 2-Ring Context

```
For each partition:
  1. Extract sub-mesh (vertices, faces) with local indexing
  2. Identify border vertices in local coordinates:
     - Vertices from 2-ring extension
     - Vertices on spatial partition boundaries
  3. Simplify using QEM with 2-ring context:
     - Skip edges involving border vertices
     - Only collapse interior core edges
     - Preserve all border vertex positions
     - Benefit from 2-ring faces for accurate quadric calculations
  4. Rebuild simplified sub-mesh
  5. Filter faces to only include those with core vertices
```

### Step 3: Merging with Deduplication

```
1. Initialize global vertex map and face list

2. For each simplified sub-mesh:
   a. Identify vertices actually used by (core) faces
   b. Map local vertices to global indices
   c. Deduplicate vertices by:
      - Original vertex ID (for border vertices)
      - Position matching (with tolerance 1e-6)
   d. Reindex faces to use global vertex indices

3. Remove duplicate faces (same vertices, any order)

4. Output final mesh (vertices, faces)
```

## Mathematical Foundation

### Quadric Error Metric (QEM)

For each vertex v, compute quadric matrix Q:
```
Q = Σ Kp
```

where Kp is the quadric for each plane (face) adjacent to v:
```
Kp = [a²   ab   ac   ad]
     [ab   b²   bc   bd]
     [ac   bc   c²   cd]
     [ad   bd   cd   d²]
```

and (a, b, c, d) is the plane equation: ax + by + cz + d = 0

### Edge Collapse Cost

When collapsing edge (v1, v2), the cost is:
```
cost = v̄ᵀ Q v̄
```

where:
- Q = Q₁ + Q₂ (sum of quadrics for both vertices)
- v̄ is the optimal position for the merged vertex

### Optimal Position

Solve for v̄ that minimizes the error:
```
[Q₁₁ Q₁₂ Q₁₃] [x]   [Q₁₄]
[Q₂₁ Q₂₂ Q₂₃] [y] = -[Q₂₄]
[Q₃₁ Q₃₂ Q₃₃] [z]   [Q₃₄]
```

If matrix is singular, use midpoint of edge.

## Key Features

### 1. Border Preservation

Border vertices are preserved to ensure:
- Sub-meshes can be merged without gaps
- Partition boundaries remain compatible
- No cracks in the final mesh

### 2. Vertex Deduplication

The merger uses two strategies:
- **Index-based**: For border vertices with known original indices
- **Position-based**: For vertices within tolerance threshold (1e-6)

This handles cases where:
- Vertices are shared between partitions
- Simplification creates new vertex positions
- Numerical precision differences exist

### 3. Face Deduplication

Faces are deduplicated by:
- Sorting vertex indices
- Using set to track unique face tuples
- Prevents duplicate faces from overlapping partitions

### 4. Flexible Partitioning

The octree approach:
- Creates balanced partitions
- Works for arbitrary mesh sizes
- Can be extended to more partitions (16, 27, etc.)

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Command-line Processing
```bash
python mesh_simplification_mdd_lme.py
```
Processes all PLY files in input directory.

### Pattern 2: Single File
```python
from mesh_simplification_mdd_lme import process_ply_file

process_ply_file(
    "input.ply",
    "output.ply",
    target_ratio=0.5,
    num_partitions=8
)
```

### Pattern 3: Programmatic
```python
from mesh_simplification_mdd_lme import simplify_mesh_with_partitioning
from QEM import PLYReader, PLYWriter

vertices, faces = PLYReader.read_ply("input.ply")
simplified_v, simplified_f = simplify_mesh_with_partitioning(
    vertices, faces, target_ratio=0.5
)
PLYWriter.write_ply("output.ply", simplified_v, simplified_f)
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity

- **Partitioning**: O(V + F) where V = vertices, F = faces
- **Simplification**: O(E log E) per partition where E = edges
- **Merging**: O(V_total) where V_total = sum of simplified vertices

### Space Complexity

- **Partitioning**: O(V + F) for partition data structures
- **Simplification**: O(V + F) per partition (processed independently)
- **Merging**: O(V_total + F_total) for final mesh

### Advantages

1. **Memory efficient**: Processes partitions independently
2. **Parallelizable**: Each partition can be simplified in parallel
3. **Scalable**: Handles large meshes by partitioning
4. **Boundary preservation**: Maintains mesh connectivity

### Limitations

2. **Small partitions**: Less effective for very small meshes
3. **Octree bias**: Partition quality depends on mesh distribution
